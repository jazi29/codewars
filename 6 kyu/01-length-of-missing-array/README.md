[Length of missing array](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57b6f5aadb5b3d0ae3000611)

You get an array of arrays.
If you sort the arrays by their length, you will see, that their length-values are consecutive.
But one array is missing!


If the array of arrays is null/nil or empty, the method should return 0.

When an array in the array is null or empty, the method should return 0 too!
There will always be a missing element and its length will be always between the given arrays.
